This project examines two Markov Decision Process (MDP) problems – the Frozen Lake Problem and the Gambler’s Problem using [OpenAI gym](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) and [bettermdptools](https://github.com/jlm429/bettermdptools) which are reinforcement learning algorithms or frameworks. The Frozen Lake Problem is implemented with a small number of states (100 states) and the Gambler’s Problem is implemented with a large number of states (500 states). Policy and value iteration algorithms are run on these two MDP problems. Subsequently, the Q-Learning algorithm, a reinforcement learning algorithm, is run on these two MDP problems.
